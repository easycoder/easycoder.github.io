## The System Controller

Here are all the files that are installed on the system controller, a small computer located in the premises where heating is being managed. Two different controller models are catered for; a Raspberry Pi (Model B onwards) and an Orange Pi Zero 2.

To install RBR on a new system (one of the above), connect it to your internet router with an Ethernet cable then follow the instructions in the user interface at [https://rbrheating.com](https://rbrheating.com). Tap/click on the hamburger icon, choose Help, go to the index and from there to the System Controller page.
