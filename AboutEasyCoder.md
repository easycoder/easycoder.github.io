### What is EasyCoder - and why? ###

Programming is getting complicated. As new techniques come along it gets harder and harder to keep up. Even professional programmers have difficulty knowing which new technology to follow and how to get proficient in it.

When computers were young - back in the 1970s and 80s - programming was open to all, and many of the software products we take for granted now have their roots in the efforts of amateurs. Excel is the logical development of VisiCalc, for example, and even the mighty Microsoft Windows owes a lot to CP/M. Products like these often resulted from the efforts of very small teams, often of 1 or 2 people, but now there's no room for the amateur programmer in any but the simplest of environments.

Yet there are software tools that are accessible by ordinary people. Every trainee accountant uses Excel macros, and databases can be managed with SQL, which although able to do some pretty powerful things is pretty simple to use (at the outset, at least).

In the world of the browser, things are divided between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML defines _what_ goes into the page and CSS describes _how_ it looks. JavaScript adds interactivity and the ability to customise the page after it loads.

By way of explanation, every page you see is produced by code running on the web server. WordPress and its themes are composed of a lot of PHP files working together and using your information - stored in a database - to build the page that is sent to the browser. Because you didn't write the PHP code yourself you have limited control over it; the color scheme, the fonts and the general layout are all decided by the theme designer. They may allow you to customise a little and sometimes there's a plugin to adjust some part of the display, but essentially you get what you're given. JavaScript running in the browser lets you tinker with the page _after_ it arrives and without the server knowing anything about it.

The trouble for most WordPress users is that JavaScript is a huge programming language in which there are always several different ways to do the same thing. It's quite easy to learn some basic JavaScript but very hard to get beyond the baby steps. Most WordPress page designers are not professional programmers; they deal primarily with the _what_ and _how_ of HTML and CSS.

In general there are quite a small number of things you need to do with JavaScript. It's not computing rocket trajectories or drug doses; it's just taking elements of your HTML and altering them in some way. Maybe it's changing the CSS of an element so it shows in a different color, or with a different border color, or... there are so many things you might want to do but they mostly amount to changing a CSS style somewhere.

**_EasyCoder_** aims to simplify the job of writing code that runs in the browser and does things with your page. It's a programmming language that aims to looks as much like English as possible and the script is contained in the page itself, right next to the HTML it controls. All you need is to install our plugin, add some IDs to the elements of your page you want to control then write a suitable script, placing it inside a special preformatted element. It doesn't require any formal programming experience but professionals might also find it can save them time and leave a result their clients can understand later if they want to make changes.
