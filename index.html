		<h2 id="ec-body">Developer Notes</h2>
		<p>My name is Graham Trott and I&#8217;m the author of EasyCoder. I&#8217;m writing this in
			January 2020 and I&#8217;m currently 71 years old.</p>
		<p>If you are reading this it&#8217;s for one of a couple of reasons.
			You may be curious to see what the page source code looks like,
			or you may want to build something similar, perhaps long after I&#8217;m no longer available.</p>
		<p>Almost all software becomes harder and harder to read the more time passes since it was written.
			After a few years, even the original author will have some difficulty in figuring out
			what was done, and anyone coming new to a project will have major trouble
			in all but the simplest of cases. So these notes are intended to provide a starting point.</p>
		<p>EasyCoder is a custom high-level scripting language that is itself written in JavaScript.
			So you can say quite correctly that any site using it is powered by JavaScript.
			At the time of writing it&#8217;s de rigeur to use a framework such as Angular or React,
			but after a few years these will become obsolete as newer technologies arrive.
			In any case, frameworks are not designed to make it easy to pick up a project;
			they&#8217;re intended to benefit developers who are writing new code.
			As such they are an implicit admission that the language itself (JavaScript)
			is not up to the job and requires extra features not provided by its authors.</p>
		<p>My preference is to use a better language, one that is designed to do the job
			without requiring a host of bolt-on extras. Since none were available I wrote my own
			and it&#8217;s called EasyCoder and this website is the kicking-off point for all
			the information you need. The most significant part of it is our Codex, which is
			a combination of tutorial and programmer's playground designed to get you familiar with EasyCoder.</p>
		<p>To create your own EasyCoder website, see the Introduction.
			EasyCoder itself is brought in from CDN; the only local resource is the script itself,
			which is embedded in a &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; tag.
		<p>The entire EasyCoder source code repository is at
			<a href="https://github.com/easycoder">https://github.com/easycoder</a>.</p>
		<p>And that&#8217;s all I have to say. I hope to be around for a few years yet,
			so do contact me if you would like to know anything. After that it&#8217;ll be out of my hands.</p>
