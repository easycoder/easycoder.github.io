# The `show` and `hide` actions

This action shows or hides one or more blocks.

The **Action**, **Name** and **Label** properties are present for all actions, so that just leaves **Blocks**. This is a list of blocks that will be handled by this step. Add another block to the list by clicking the ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/plus.png|icon~ button.

When this action runs the blocks referenced are all made visible or invisible. You can change the order of display by moving blocks up the list using the ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/up.png|icon~ buttons. (This has no effect on the show; it's just a convenience for the programmer.) You can delete any block using the ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/stop.png|icon~ buttons.
