# User registration and login

~iwsy~ can be used without registering, in which case you are an anonymous user of the system. This is OK if all you want to do is evaluate ~iwsy~, though not all its features will be available to you. Any presentations you create will be saved to your local browser storage area and will be unavailable anywhere else. If you later decide to log in you can transfer these presentations to your own private area on the ~iwsy~ website.

## Registration

On the left-hand side of the page, above this help panel, are a row of buttons with ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/user.png:{width:1em}~ by itself at the right-hand end. This is the login button. When you click it a panel appears:

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/help/img/login.png:100%~

To register as a user, click the **Register** button. The panel then changes to:

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/help/img/register.png:100%~

Fill in all the fields and click **Register**. A popup message will appear, telling you to wait for a confirmation code to arrive by email. The registration form will have gained an extra line where you can type the 6-digit code that arrives. Click **Confirm Registration** and the form will disappear. The icon in the toolbar will now show ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/help/img/user-loggedin.png:{width:1em}~ to indicate you are registered and logged in. If you click this icon you will be logged out again.
