# The Buttons panel

Above this Help page, under the banner, is a panel of buttons. The job of each button is as follows:

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/new|png:{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Start a new presentation. This clears the workspace. If you have unsaved work it will prompt you to save it. 

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/open.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Open a saved presentation. This displays a list of all presentations and lets you select one. Note that if you are not a registered user, presentations will be saved into your browser's private space. For registered users they are saved to the ~iwsy~ website, into a space allocated to that user.

If you have unsaved work you will be prompted to save it before opening the list.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/save.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Save your current work. It will be saved using whatever name is shown in the **Script name** box below the buttons. If this box is empty you will be prompted for a name. Files all have ~m:.json~ extensions; if this is omitted it will be added.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/trash.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Delete the current presentation. You will be prompted to confirm before the delete goes ahead.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/fileman.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Open the image manager. This shows you all the images you have uploaded to our server. If you are not registered, this button is non-operational.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/run.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Run your presentation. A player is created in the spacce currently occupied by this Help page and the presentation runs without manual intervention. The button changes to ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/runstop.png|icon~. If you click this the presentation will stop.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/fullscreen.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Run your presentation in full-screen mode. This is the mode you will use when connected to an overhead projector, for example.

In fullscreen mode the presentation waits for a mouse click or a button press. A mouse click or either of the space or right-arrow keys will cause the presentation to start in manual mode, where it stops after each visual change and waits for you to click or press again. If you press the Enter key the presentation will run according to the timing given by its individual steps. You can interrupt this my clicking or by pressing space or right-arrow.

In some cases the browser will report the screen size incorrectly and some backgrounds will not show properly; if this happens it's best to select full-screen mode in your browser before clicking this button.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/help.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Display this help at the page you were last viewing.

~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/trash.png|{float:left;height:2em;margin-right:1em}~ Login or Register. This displays the ~page:users:Login panel~.
