# The Project panel

The right-hand side of the screen holds the Project panel. When you start up - or after you click the ~img:https://easycoder.github.io/iwsy/resources/icon/new.png|icon~(New) button - it looks like this:

There are 5 sections.

## 1 - Steps

This lists the steps of your presentation. These are in some way analogous to the 'slides' of a PowerPoint presentation. A step is any action that affects the presentation, whether it causes a visual change or not. Every presentation starts with an `init` step where you define the size and proportions of your screen. This step is already provided, with its name on a clickable button. When you click the button it opens the ~page:action-init:`init` step editor~. All the action types are documented in their own pages - see the ~page:contents:Contents~.

To the left of the button is a tiny ~img:/resources/icon/binoculars.png:icon~ binoculars symbol. When you click one of these the panel on the left - called the _player_ - shows you what the presentation looks like at this step.

To the right of the button is a ~img:/resources/icon/plus.png:icon~ plus symbol, that when clicked adds a new step to the end of the presentation. See ~page:addStep:Adding a step~.

## 2 - Blocks

This lists the blocks used in your presentation. A block is a rectangular area of the screen that can contain text, an image or some of each.

It's common to use the same layout for multiple slides in a presentation, and one of the problems with PowerPoint is how difficult it is to change a layout once set. Sometimes the only way is to edit the numerical coordinates of the text and other blocks on each slide; a time-consuming and error-prone task.

~iwsy~ takes a different approach. You define all the different type of block that will be used, giving each one a name, then use them on as many slides as you like. To make changes you then just need to edit the block definition; all the slides that use it will take on the new size and position. See ~page:addBlock:Adding a block~.

## 3 - Content

This lists all the content text items used in your presentation. Each one is named. In the step editor you assign content to blocks by clicking names from a drop-down list. This makes it much easier to see what is where than by having the full text visible at each point.

All content text is written using **_MarkDown_**; a format that is mostly plain text, plus simple markup tags to define headers and other text features. ~iwsy~ provides a set of custom MarkDown extensions that define image and other attributes. These help pages are written using the same system. See ~page:addContent:Adding content~.

## 4 - VFX

VFX stands for "Visual Effects". At this time we only have one; a pan and zoom. With this you can implement the "Ken Burns Effect", named after its inventor, a New York based documentary film maker. The effect is widely used in television to bring movement to still photos, without which the eye rapidly gets bored. The amount of movement can be very slight but the eye is tricked into thinking it's looking at video. The effect is demonstrated on our ~page:iwsy:Home and Introduction~ page.

This section is where you supply all the data needed to achieve the effect for a single image.

## 5 - JSON

In this section you have a listing of the entire script as a JSON file. You can view and edit any of the sections or copy/paste.
