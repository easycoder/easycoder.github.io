# ~iwsy~ - I Wanna Show You 

I Wanna Show You (~iwsy~, pronounced "You-zee" as an approximation to the initials) is an online presentation package built to deliver slideshows that either run under manual control or unattended. Instead of being a PC application that's tied to the desktop, ~iwsy~ is entirely browser-based. ~iwsy~ presentations can run here in this web app, they can be embedded in other web pages or they can run as independent web pages.

These help pages contain everything there is to know about ~iwsy~, but there's a lot to read. Most people just want to get started quickly, so we have a built-in ~page:quickstart:quick-start tutorial~ where you can create a simple presentation - a few slides with text and pictures - in just a few minutes. Once you've completed this first step you'll have a pretty good idea of what ~iwsy~ is all about, and the rest of the help pages won't be nearly as intimidating.
