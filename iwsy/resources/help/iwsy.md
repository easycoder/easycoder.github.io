# I Wanna Show You 

I Wanna Show You (IWSY, pronounced "You-zee" as an approximation to the initials) is an online presentation package. It has the ability to deliver slideshows that either run under manual control or unattended, but instead of being a PC application that's tied to the desktop, IWSY is entirely browser-based. IWSY presentations can run here in this web app, they can be embedded in other web pages or they can run as independent web pages.

The basic features of IWSY are:

 - A step editor, where you create a set of steps that together form your presentation
 - A block editor, where you define templates to control where things appear on the screen
 - A content editor, where you keep all the text that will be shown in your presentation
 - A presentation viewer that runs your shows or displays any step
 - A block viewer to visualise your blocks
 - User management - each user has their own account and storage area
 - Image management - users can create folders, upload/delete images and so on
 - Built-in help - what you're reading

The block and content editors may be an unfamiliar concept. Rather than hand-editing each slide you use blocks to define the areas of the screen that will hold text or images. Each block has a name so you can choose which ones to use for any given part of the show. Similarly, the text content is all edited separately and each item has a name.

All text input in IWSY is in MarkDown format, which is much simpler than HTML, being mostly plain text. All standard features of MarkDown are supported, plus some custom additions documented in these Help pages.
