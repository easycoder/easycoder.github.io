# ~iwsy~ - I Wanna Show You 

I Wanna Show You (~iwsy~, pronounced "You-zee" as an approximation to the initials) is a web app you can use to create slideshows that run under either manual control or unattended. Instead of being a PC application that's tied to the desktop, ~iwsy~ is entirely browser-based. ~iwsy~ presentations can run here in this web app, they can be embedded in other web pages or they can run as independent web pages.

## An example

Here is a simple show that forms the basis of our ~page:quickstart:quickstart tutorial~:

## Quickstart tutorial

These help pages contain everything there is to know about ~iwsy~, but there's a lot to read. Most people just want to get started quickly so we built a ~page:quickstart:quickstart tutorial~ where you can create a simple presentation - some slides with text and pictures - in an hour or so. Once you've completed this first step you'll have a pretty good idea of what ~iwsy~ is all about, and the rest of the help pages won't be nearly as intimidating.

## Feature summary

There are many slideshow/presentation packages, most being quite similar to PowerPoint. The aim here is not to create another identical one but to tackle one or two of the things the others don't do so well. Top of the list is the ability to embed a show into another web page in a seamless manner. The development of ~iwsy~ is driven by the desire to meet this need rather than to excel at formal presentations.

We are also working on a range of features for making the pages themselves dynamic. This covers a number of areas such as transitions, "Ken Burns" effects and the use of audio.

The basic features of ~iwsy~ are:

 - A step editor, where you create a set of steps that together form your presentation
 - A block editor, where you define templates to control where things appear on the screen
 - A content editor, where you keep all the text that will be shown in your presentation
 - A presentation viewer that runs your shows or displays any step
 - A block viewer to visualise your blocks
 - User management - each user has their own account and storage area
 - Image management - users can create folders, upload/delete images and so on
 - Built-in help - what you're reading

## Background

~iwsy~ started at the beginning of May 2020 with a need to embed a slide show in a web page, but rather than just a sequence of pictures I wanted something between that and a video. Videos are time-consuming to make and almost impossible to alter when changes happen to the things being described. Presentation packages such as PowerPoint, on the other hand, are very flexible when it comes to making changes but lack extensive animation features and are hard to embed in a web page. It seemed to me there was room between the two for a new type of product, and once the idea took hold it was hard to put down. It coincided with the Coronoavirus pandemic, which enforced solitude at home and provided the time for development to take place.
