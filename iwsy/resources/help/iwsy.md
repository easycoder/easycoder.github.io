# I Wanna Show You 

I Wanna Show You (IWSY, pronounced "You-zee" as an approximation to the initials) is an online presentation package. It's built to deliver slideshows that either run under manual control or unattended, but instead of being a PC application that's tied to the desktop, IWSY is entirely browser-based. IWSY presentations can run here in this web app, they can be embedded in other web pages or they can run as independent web pages.

## Quick-start

These help pages contain everything there is to know about IWSY, but there's a lot to read. Most people just want to get started quickly, so we have a built-in ~page:quickstart:quick-start tutorial~ where you can create a simple presentation - a few slides with text and pictures - in just a few minutes. Once you've completed this first step you'll have a pretty good idea of what IWSY is all about, and the rest of the help pages won't be nearly as intimidating.

## Feature summary

The basic features of IWSY are:

 - A step editor, where you create a set of steps that together form your presentation
 - A block editor, where you define templates to control where things appear on the screen
 - A content editor, where you keep all the text that will be shown in your presentation
 - A presentation viewer that runs your shows or displays any step
 - A block viewer to visualise your blocks
 - User management - each user has their own account and storage area
 - Image management - users can create folders, upload/delete images and so on
 - Built-in help - what you're reading
 - A ~page:quickstart:quick-start tutorial~
