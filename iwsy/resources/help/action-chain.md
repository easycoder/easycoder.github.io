# The `chain` action

Large, dynamic presentations or slideshows may have dozens or even hundreds of steps, making then increasingly difficult to manage or even to visualize. However, presentations are linear entities that usually comprise a number of independent sections, one following another. If you are working on the introduction part of your show, the rest of it is of little immediate interest - it may as well be another presentation completely.

To take advantage of this structual feature of the average presentation, ~iwsy~ provides the ~m:chain~ action, which terminates the current show, loads a new one and starts it running. As long as you provide a suitable "bridge" the effect is seamless. Each of the sections can be a full presentation in its own right and can be developed independently of all the others.
