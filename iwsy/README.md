# IWSY

IWSY is I Wanna Show You, a web app for building slide shows and presentations that embed in web pages. It is **not** in any way a PowerPoint clone. The complete source and documentation are here, but the latter uses enhanced MarkDown and is best viewed on the [IWSY](https://iwannashowyou.com) website itself, where there is also a quickstart tutorial.
