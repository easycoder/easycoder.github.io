# If

The second example is a handler for the `if` statement; a vital part of any language. The full spec is this:

```
    if <condition> then <command> else <command>
```
where the `else` clause may or may not be present. Here's the current _**EasyCoder**_ code for the `if` handler:
```
	If: {

		compile: compiler => {
			const lino = compiler.getLino();
			compiler.next();
			const condition = compiler.condition.compile(compiler);
			const pc = compiler.getPc();
			compiler.addCommand({
				domain: `core`,
				keyword: `if`,
				lino,
				condition
			});
			// Get the 'then' code
			compiler.compileOne();
			if (!compiler.getToken()) {
				compiler.getCommandAt(pc).else = compiler.getPc();
				return true;
			}
			if (compiler.tokenIs(`else`)) {
				const goto = compiler.getPc();
				// Add a 'goto' to skip the 'else'
				compiler.addCommand({
					domain: `core`,
					keyword: `goto`,
					lino,
					goto: 0
				});
				// Fixup the link to the 'else' branch
				compiler.getCommandAt(pc).else = compiler.getPc();
				// Process the 'else' branch
				compiler.next();
				// Add the 'else' branch
				compiler.compileOne(true);
				// Fixup the 'goto'
				compiler.getCommandAt(goto).goto = compiler.getPc();
			} else {
				// We're at the next command
				compiler.getCommandAt(pc).else = compiler.getPc();
			}
			return true;
		},

		run: program => {
			// To be covered later
        {
	},
```
It starts the same way as for all handlers, by obtaining the current line number. Then it calls the _condition compiler_ to process the condition. As with `compiler.getValue()` I'll cover this in a later section of this book. The value returned is an object describing how to evaluate the condition at runtime.

Next we get the current PC value and save it. Then we create a command object and append it to the program using `compiler.addCommand(command)`.

Now we call `compiler.compileOne()` to compile the 'then' code - a single command. This might be just that - a single command - or it might be a block of commands. In _**EasyCoder**_ the latter is done with `begin...end` pairs. Between `begin` and `end` there can be any number of commands, including more `begin...end`s. Many readers will immediately spot recursion happening here, and this is the reason why the entire compiler is run from an _instance_ of itself, allowing other instances to be created without any risk of them interfering with each other. By calling every compiler function as `compiler.xxx()` we preserve the environment for each compilation thread. The previous compiler instance remains 'parked' while `compiler.compileOne()` runs.

Having processed the 'then' code we check if we're at the end of the script. If there's more we check for `else`. If this is not present, all that remains is to set up things so that if the test fails the program resumes past the 'then' command(s). So we use `compiler.getCommandAt(pc)` to retrieve the command we saved earlier, and we add to it an `else` property giving the program counter value we're at now. So when the test passes we go through the 'then' block but when it fails we jump to the following command.

When there's an `else` it's a bit more complicated.The first thing is to add a `goto` command to the program. It's value is unimportant as we'll be updating it. Then we post an `else` property into the `if` command as described in the previous paragraph. Then we call `compiler.compileOne()` as before to process the `else` command or block, then finally put the current program counter into the saved `goto` command. The result is that if the test passes we execute the 'then' block', which finishes with a jump to the first command past the `else` block. If the test fails we go directly to the `else` block then fall into the following code.

The `while` command operates in a similar way, so rather than spell it out here I'll leave the reader to examine the _**EasyCoder**_ source or simply work it out as an exercise.
