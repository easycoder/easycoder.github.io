# About this book

_Programming in English_ aims to debunk the idea that programming can only be done by highly qualified professionals. This notion is heavily promoted by the software industry, but in spite of massive computer power and the arrival of ever more sophisticated programming tools and frameworks, well over half of all software projects continue to be delivered late, over budget and not meeting the expectations of their users. The main reason for this is that those who understand the problem space - its users - are unable to contribute to or oversee the software development process, which is left in the hands of those who understand the technology but not the real world.

## Low Code

The Low Code movement, of which _**EasyCoder**_ and this book are a part, aims to provide the means for users to take their own ideas and implement them as working programs without the need to hire professional programmers. The software industry is split between those offering Low Code solutions and those who feel threatened by them, so it's hard to find truly objective sources of information. However, it is widely predicted that Low Code will dominate software production over the coming years. This does not remove the need for professional software engineers; far from it, they will be needed to improve the Low Code tools themselves.

There are two kinds of software:

 1. The first kind is what drives the user experience and manages business logic, which is often highly unstructured. Low Code and No Code are rapidly taking over.

 1. The second kind is what is used to create and optimize the tools needed by the first kind. Software engineers and mainstream programming languages will always be needed here.

It's important to be clear about these two kinds of software. Only a full understanding of the distinction will allow appropriate business strategy decisions be made. Without it, projects will continue to run late and fail on the one hand or become cumbersome and unreliable on the other.

## Storyteller

This book is built using Storyteller, a system for organizing text files written in an extended Markdown format. The system is fully documented at [its own website](https://storyteller-framework.netlify.app/).

Storyteller, itself written in _**EasyCoder**_, permits documentation such as this book to be created entirely using Markdown, avoiding the need for HTML except for minor tweaks. Any text editor can be used to author the content and the results appear instantly after saving to the web host.

### Customising this website

You may like to experiment with an alternative _theme_; that is, the border style of the page. Storyteller offers a small choice of different themes and you can choose from those currently available by clicking ~theme:here~.
