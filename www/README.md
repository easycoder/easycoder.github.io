### EasyCoder ###

This repository is the home of a GitHub-hosted static version of **_EasyCoder_**. The URL of the site itself (under development) is [https://gtanyware.github.io](https://gtanyware.github.io) and the expectation is that this version will still be available long after the current main site disappears.

## EasyCoder Codex ##

A key feature of the website is  the **_EasyCoder_ Codex**, a complete IDE for building and maintaining websites based on **_EasyCoder_** scripts. It includes a tutorial for beginners, a programmer's playground and a complete set of reference guides for the scripting language.
