# About EasyCoder #
The main features of ~ec~ are as follows:

~ec~ looks like English; not conversational English, admittedly, but the sort of English we use when giving directions or following a recipe. A formalized version of English, that doesn't use the symbols usually found in conventional programming languages, which cause ordinary people such grief when trying to match brackets or figure what a triple-equals is for.

~ec~ has a fully pluggable architecture, which means plugins can be written by any competent programmer and offered free or for a charge to provide any desired functionality to page builders.

~ec~ is for beginners. It's probably one of the simplest ways to start programming in general and website coding in particular.

~ec~ is also for experts. As a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool it makes for great productivity, enabling you to build web applications far more quickly. Use it in conjunction with other tools or by itself, avoid huge learning curves and build websites that are far easier to maintain.

~ec~ is easy to learn. Elsewhere in these pages you'll find sample code and complete websites with source code. You can also try writing your own scripts with the help of an online tutorial such as our coding playground, the /CODEX/.

Coding services
~ec~ scripts are easy to read by most people who have an understanding of what is being done. They are experts in their domain and the script does its best to match that domain. Even so, there are some who don't want to do programming in any way yet would still like to enjoy the results of it. For you we offer a consultancy service. If you would like your pages enhanced in some specific way and are thinking maybe ~ec~ could do it, you can ask a question by joining our /SLACK/. We'll be pleased to discuss your needs in complete privacy and without obligation.
