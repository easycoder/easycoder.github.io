<h2>Basic arithmetic</h2><p><span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> is designed for the web; to build apps that do stuff in a browser. The world of the browser is primarily visual, with lots of images and text, but there&#39;s always a need for some basic arithmetic so we&#39;ll write a couple of scripts that illustrate what&#39;s available.</p><p>In most computer languages, if you want to add numbers together it will look like your school algebra:</p><p><span style="color:#660033"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Z = X + Y</span></span></p><p>but that&#39;s not how you&#39;d express it in written or spoken English. Instead, you might say</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y giving Z</span></span></p><p>where <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">giving</span></span> is a shorthand for &quot;and put the result into&quot;.</p><p>As it happens, this is exactly how <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> does it too. Here you are adding the <em>values</em> X and Y together and putting the result into a <em>variable</em> called Z.</p><p>The words <em>value</em> and <em>variable</em> have specific meanings. A <em>value</em> is anything you can measure or count, such as cars or pennies or days. <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> doesn&#39;t care what they are; it just knows you have an X pile and a Y pile of them and want to add them together into a Z pile.</p><p>A <em>variable</em> is a little more specific; it&#39;s a container where something is stored. Your wallet or purse contains money having a certain value, so the purse also has that value. A dollar or a pound, on the other hand, have specific values; they can&#39;t contain other things so they can&#39;t be variables. All this means is that in the sum above, X and Y can be either values or variables (containing values), but Z can&#39;t be a simple value; it must be a variable because we&#39;re putting something (the sum of X and Y) into it.</p><p>A variant of this sum is where you want to add value X to whatever is already in Y. The sum is simpler:</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y</span></span></p><p>Here, X can be a value or a variable but Y must be a variable because it&#39;s being changed.</p><p>Of course, arithmetic is more than just addition. There&#39;s also subtraction, multiplication and division too. Here&#39;s what they all look like:</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y</span></span></td>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y giving Z</span></span></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">take X from Y</span></span></td>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">take X from Y giving Z</span></span></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">multiply Y by X</span></span></td>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">multiply Y by X giving Z</span></span></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">divide Y by X</span></span></td>			<td style="width:50%"><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">divide Y by Z giving Z</span></span></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Note that in the left-hand column, multiplication and division work the opposite way round to addition and subtraction, with the result of the sum (Y) being the first item, not the second. That&#39;s a peculiarity of English; <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> just goes along with it. Few if any other computer languages are so accommodating.</p><p>Although I&#39;ve used just X and Y, you can also do arithmetic with numbers:</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add 4 to X<br />take 3 from 13 giving Y</span></span></p><p>and so on. At which point let&#39;s start coding. Copy this code to the editor or tap the <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Copy to editor</span></span> button:</p><p style="text-align:center"> </p><div id="clear" style="display:none">n</div><div id="code">yes</div><p style="margin-left:40px; text-align:center"><a href="#" id="copy">Copy to editor</a></p><p>At the top there&#39;s a line starting with an exclamation mark. We programmers sometimes call it a &quot;shriek&quot;. (Computer humor is mostly no better than this.) The line is called a comment, which means it isn&#39;t program code and has no effect at all on the program. It&#39;s just there to aid the programmer. A comment can be on a line by itself or it can be the last item on a program line.</p><p>The program itself starts by &quot;declaring&quot; all the variables it will use. There are a variety of different types of variable in <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span>; here we use the simplest kind, one that can hold a numeric or textual value. The variable itself starts with a capital letter, just as names do in English. You must declare variables before you can use them or the program will refuse to run. Try it and see by leaving out one of the variables or giving it the wrong name. This will introduce you to the way <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> handles errors.</p><p>In the <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">alert</span></span> command you&#39;ll see the word <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">cat</span></span> used to build a string of text by &#39;catenating&#39; 2 items together. Apart from that I hope it&#39;s all easy to follow even if you&#39;re completely new to coding.</p><p>If at any time you want to find out about a particular command, click the <img alt="" src="resources/icon/book.png" style="height:20px; width:20px" /> button at the top of this panel and you&#39;ll be switched to the <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> Programmer&#39;s Reference manual.
