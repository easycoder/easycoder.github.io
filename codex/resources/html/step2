<h2>Basic arithmetic</h2><p><span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> is designed for the web; to build apps that do stuff in a browser. The world of the browser is primarily visual, with lots of images and text, but there&#39;s always a need for some basic arithmetic so we&#39;ll write a couple of scripts that illustrate what&#39;s available.</p><p>In most computer languages, if you want to add numbers together it will look like your school algebra:</p><p><span style="color:#660033"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Z = X + Y</span></span></p><p>but that&#39;s not how you&#39;d express it in written or spoken English. Instead, you might say</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y giving Z</span></span></p><p>where <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">giving</span></span> is a shorthand for &quot;and put the result into&quot;.</p><p>As it happens, this is exactly how <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> does it too. Here you are adding the <em>values</em> X and Y together and putting the result into a <em>variable</em> called Z.</p><p>The words <em>value</em> and <em>variable</em> have specific meanings. A <em>value</em> is anything you can measure or count, such as cars or pennies or days. <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> doesn&#39;t care what they are; it just knows you have an X pile and a Y pile of them and want to add them together into a Z pile.</p><p>A <em>variable</em> is a little more specific; it&#39;s a container where something is stored. Your wallet or purse contains money having a certain value, so the purse also has that value, but although a dollar or a pound have values they can&#39;t contain other things, so they can&#39;t be variables. All this means is that X and Y can be simple values or variables having values, but Z must be a variable.</p><p>A variant of this sum is where you want to add value X to whatever is already in Y. The sum is simpler:</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add X to Y</span></span></p><p>Again, X can be any value but Y must be a variable.</p><p>Of course, arithmetic is more than just addition. There&#39;s also subtraction, multiplication and division too. Here&#39;s what they all look like:</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td>add X to Y</td>			<td>add X to Y giving Z</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>take X from Y</td>			<td>take X from Y giving Z</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>multiply Y by X</td>			<td>multiply Y by X giving Z</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td>divide Y by X</td>			<td>divide Y by Z giving Z</td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Note that in the left-hand column, multiplication and division work the opposite way round to addition and subtraction, with the result of the sum (Y) being the first item, not the second.</p><p>Although I&#39;ve used just X and Y, you can also do arithmetic with numbers:</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">add 4 to X<br />take 3 from 13 giving Y</span></span></p><p>and so on. At which point let&#39;s start coding. Copy this code to the editor or tap the <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Copy to editor</span></span> button:</p><p style="text-align:center"> </p><div id="clear" style="display:none">n</div><div id="code">yes</div><p style="margin-left:40px; text-align:center"><a href="#" id="copy">Copy to editor</a></p><div>In the <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">alert</span></span> command you&#39;ll see the word <span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">cat</span> used to &#39;catenate&#39; 2 strings together. Apart from that I hope it&#39;s all easy to follow even if you&#39;re completely new to coding.</div><p>If at any time you want to find out about a particular command, click the <img alt="" src="resources/icon/book.png" style="height:20px; width:20px" /> button at the top of this panel and you&#39;ll be switched to the <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> Programmer&#39;s Reference manual. You need to select a package - most of the commands we&#39;ll be using are in either <strong>Core</strong> or <strong>Browser</strong> - and choose <strong>Commands</strong>, <strong>Values</strong> or <strong>Conditions</strong>. There&#39;s a drop-down list of all the keywords in that section.
