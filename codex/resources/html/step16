<h2>Using Google Maps</h2><p>One of the strengths of <span style="color:#660033"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>E</strong></span></span><span style="color:#000099"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>asy</strong></span></span><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>C</strong></span></span><span style="color:#000099"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>oder</strong></span></span> is the way it can be extended using <em>plugins</em>. These are JavaScript code modules that provide extra language features to users of the system. <span style="color:#660033"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>E</strong></span></span><span style="color:#000099"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>asy</strong></span></span><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>C</strong></span></span><span style="color:#000099"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace"><strong>oder</strong></span></span> comes with a number of these, available on demand, so I&#39;ll demonstrate how to use one of the more interesting ones.</p><p>Google Maps are one of the most spectacular features to be found on any website. They provide a vast range of features and require very little effort to include on the page. That said, it takes some effort to learn how to do it, and we&#39;ve taken away that effort by building our own EasyCoder plugin to handle maps for you. Currently it&#39;s a little basic but we hope to add more features as time goes by.</p><p>Because the plugin provides the means to compile the new language additions it must be loaded before you try to run a script that includes those features. This is normally taken care of in your web page; if you want to know how, click the <img alt="" src="https://codex.easycoder.software/resources/icon/tools.png" style="height:16px; width:16px" /> icon above this panel to go to our Tools page. Here we deal with the problem by first running a script that loads the plugin. It has just one line:</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">load plugin `gmap`</span></span></p><p>and once the plugin is loaded it will be available for the remainder of your session. If you forget to load it you&#39;ll get an error when you try to run your map script. So put the single line above into the editor and run it now. You may also think it&#39;s worth saving too. Then click below to load the map script.</p><div id="clear" style="display:none">y</div><div id="code"> </div><div style="color:#660000; text-align:center"><a href="#" id="copy">Load example code into the editor</a></div><p>The script builds a page using the full space available, then divides it into a Controls bar and the main map panel itself. The Controls bar only has a title but there&#39;s space to put whatever buttons you might need to control the operation of your map.</p><p>In the variable list you&#39;ll see <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">gmap</span></span> <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Map</span></span>. This is part of the new functionality available with the plugin loaded, as are the commands later that make reference to the <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Map</span></span>.</p><p>The map itself requires a <span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">div</span></span> to place it in, then you can create the map using a very small set of commands. The first thing to add to the map is an &#39;API key&#39; provided by Google to authorize the use of a map on this website. You can get your own API key by registering as a Google developer and requesting your key on the appropriate page. (Unfortunately it&#39;s beyond the scope of these notes to describe how to do it.) This particular key is one that restricts usage to pages on a limited range of websites, of which this is one.</p><p>There are only 3 items of information needed to set up a map; latitude, longitude and zoom. Experiment with each of these to discover how they work; try to get a map displaying your own home.</p><h2>Next: <a href="#" id="next">Pick, Drag and Drop</a></h2>
