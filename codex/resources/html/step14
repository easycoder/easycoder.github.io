<h2>Advanced sorting</h2><p>The previous example was simple, but sometimes the elements of a list comprise a number of values. For a shopping list you might have the price, the stock ID and so on. Here we&#39;ll modify our list to add prices, then sort by price as well as alphabetically.</p><div id="clear" style="display:none">y</div><div id="code"> </div><div style="color:#660000; text-align:center"><a href="#" id="copy">Load example code into the editor</a></div><p>The list now has the same items, but each one contains 2 values; the name of the item and its price (in pence, cents or whatever, <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000099"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000099"><strong>oder</strong></span> doesn&#39;t handle floating-point values). At the start of the previous step I mentioned that the JSON format can handle things other than lists; here we have a <em>property map</em>; a set of values each having a key to say what it is - here name or price - and the value itself. Each of the items is separately added to a list, so the overall structure is a list of items each having 2 properties.</p><p>Everything else is the same as the previous example - apart from the comparator function, which now has to dive into the properties to find the price and do the comparison on that. I&#39;ve renamed the function to make that clear.</p><p>As before there&#39;s a small gotcha for you, in that milk and sugar have the same price but sugar displays first because it comes first in the list. We can make these 2 items appear in alphabetic order by changing line 98 to</p><p><span style="color:#660000"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">else<br />begin<br />if property `name` of A is greater than property `name` of B<br />put 1 into Result<br />else if property `name` of A is less than property `name` of B<br />put -1 into Result<br />else put 0 into Result<br />end</span></span></p><p>The next page will show you how to extract just some of the elements of a list.</p><h2>Next: <a href="#" id="next">Filtering lists</a></h2>
