### EasyCoder Codex ###

**_EasyCoder_** Codex is a complete IDE for building and maintaining websites based on **_EasyCoder_** scripts. It includes a tutorial for beginners and a complete set of reference guides for the scripting language.

The Codex can be used as the core of a web page. Just rename index.html (for example to codex.html) and create a new index.html with an internal reference that loads your main script. All site development and maintenance can be done using the script editor. To get started go to [EasyCoder Codex](https://codex.easycoder.software)

### Installing the Codex ###
Codex is a self-contained package that run on any suitable hosting. Download the `codex.zip` file to an empty site root and unzip it. Your host should provide a recent version of PHP. Self-hosting allows the scripts you write to be saved to your server, whereas when running from our server your scripts are saved to browser local storage.
