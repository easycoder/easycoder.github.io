<h2>Filtering lists</h2><p>Filtering is rather similar to sorting, but instead of changing the order of the items in a list it removes unwanted ones. The syntax of the command is very similar and like sorting it uses a function to do the work; this time it&#39;s called a <em>filter function</em>.</p><p>The example is the same shopping list as before, but here we want to remove from the list all items having a value less than one pound (or dollar, euro, etc.)</p><div id="clear" style="display:none">y</div><div id="code"> </div><div style="color:#660000; text-align:center"><a href="#" id="copy">Load example code into the editor</a></div><p>The list now has the same items but there&#39;s an extra button under the panel, which when clicked filters the list. It also sorts what&#39;s left, so you can see the two commands one after the other. The filter function itself is simpler than the comparator; only a single value is presented each time. The result, instead of having one of three values now only has two; true or false depending if the value should be accepted or rejected.</p><p>Sorting and filtering are a crucial part of much data management and the use of custom comparison and filter functions makes it very easy to control the process.</p><h2>Next: <a href="#" id="next">Using Google Maps</a></h2>
