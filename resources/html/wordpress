<h1 style="text-align:center">For WordPress users</h1><p>So you&#39;ve built yourself a WordPress website and you&#39;d like to add some interactivity. For this you need a program - otherwise known as a <em>script</em> - and some element on your page to make interactive. You may have been told that JavaScript is your only option and you may have already tried it and found it rather intimidating; if so, here&#39;s a simpler alternative.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with something super simple. Create a new Page or Post, go to the editor and select Text mode (not Visual). In the latest versions of WordPress this can be a little tricky to find; look in the page settings. Now add this line of code:</p><pre>/CODE1/</pre><p><strong>Update</strong> then <strong>View</strong> your Page and check the text appears.</p><p>We&#39;re going to write a script that does something when you click the text.</p><p>You&#39;ll need to get <em><strong>EasyCoder</strong></em> from the WordPress plugins library. Installing plugins is very easy, but if you&#39;ve never added one before and need help there are plenty of step by step guides. You&#39;ll need to go to the plugins page, click <strong>Add New</strong> then search for <em><strong>EasyCoder</strong></em>. Once you&#39;ve installed the plugin and activated it, return here and continue.</p><p>Now head back to the editor and add a couple of lines. This is what it will look like:</p><pre>/CODE2/</pre><p>This is a special piece of HTML that <em><strong>EasyCoder</strong></em> looks for when the page starts up. You&#39;ll never see it on your page, but anything inside it is assumed to be the script you want to run. So let&#39;s add some code between the two lines above:</p><pre>/CODE3/</pre><p>Here we define a &quot;variable&quot; called <strong>MyText</strong> and attach it to the <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> containing the message. Variables are named items that hold values of some kind, so when you use the variable you are accessing the data it contains - or in this case the <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> it&#39;s attached to.</p><p>By &quot;attach&quot;, what I mean is the variable <strong>MyText</strong> looks for the screen element having the id <strong>my-first</strong>, and that&#39;s what you have as the first line. Now, anything we do with <strong>MyText</strong> will operate directly on that screen element.</p><p>Just about the simplest interactivity we can have is to pop up a message when you click the text, so that&#39;s what the third line does</p><p><strong>Update</strong> and <strong>View</strong> the page again. Click the text and you should get the popup alert. Voila! Your <em><strong>EasyCoder</strong></em> script is running!</p><p>Now you&#39;ve got this far, the best place to learn more is our <a href="#" id="wordpress-codex">Codex</a>; a tutorial and programmer&#39;s playground where you can write and test scripts. It also includes a full reference manual for the <em><strong>EasyCoder</strong></em> programming language.</p>
