<h1>Coding can be fun!</h1><p>Welcome to the <span style="color:#660000"><strong>E</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>asy</strong></span><span style="color:#660000"><strong>C</strong></span><span style="color:#000066"><strong>oder</strong></span> Codex, a comprehensive free resource where you can learn to code using English-like scripts and use the skills you gain to build and manage websites of any complexity. (Experienced developers: See the note at the foot of this page.)</p><p>We all have coding skills. Without them we wouldn&#39;t be able to follow simple instructions such as how to cook a meal or do simple car maintenance. Just look at a recipe; it&#39;s a bit like a computer program (written in a kind of simplified English). That&#39;s not surprising, because computers also follow instructions; in fact, that&#39;s <em>all</em> they can do. A computer program is just a set of instructions, though often a lot more complex than the ones we find in everyday life. And a coder is someone who has learned how to read and write these instructions.</p><p>Coding is about learning a particular way of thinking, then using that skill to solve problems, and this website is a place to learn that skill. It&#39;s suitable for anyone from pre-teens upwards.</p><p>This tutorial takes you through the basics of coding, using simple example scripts you can run in the editor itself. It&#39;s designed to work on a smartphone as well as on a desktop computer. Well maybe not quite <em>as well</em>; it&#39;s not as easy on a small screen but you can do it, although it&#39;s quite a bit easier to use a PC or at least a tablet.</p><p>You&#39;ll be coding with a scripting language that&#39;s much quicker to learn than those used by professional programmers. Just as with recipes, it&#39;s possible to write computer code in a form that looks a lot like English. Many beginners think they should start with one of the mainstream computer languages - C, Java, Python and so on - because that will get them more quickly to their goal of making money from coding. Unfortunately, there is no short cut to becoming a professional programmer; it takes years of studying code written by others in a variety of languages, writing your own code, making mistakes, fixing them and learning from experts. The sooner you learn the basics, the sooner you&#39;ll be able to get onto all the more complex stuff.</p><p>We&#39;ll try to make it as simple as possible by making no assumptions about your level of experience. And we try to make it fun by having examples that do interesting things.</p><p>So let&#39;s take our first step into the world of coding.

Scripts written here can be deployed as web apps with few changes being needed in most cases.</p><p>You can also download and run Codex locally on your own computer. There&#39;s no difference except that when you save a script it will be written to a file on the computer&#39;s hard drive instead of being kept in browser storage. This can be very convenient as it allows you to write and test code even without an Internet connection.</p><p>If you install Codex on your server you can build and manage your entire website from within Codex; even on a smartphone.
