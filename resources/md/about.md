# About EasyCoder #

Most websites are quite easy to describe in English, yet programmers write their code in JavaScript, which looks nothing like English and which for anyone other than an expert is very hard to follow. So we created ~ec~, a language that looks a lot like English and lets you code much the same way you describe your site. It's a productivity tool you can use to build parts of websites or even entire websites.

For example, suppose you want to react to the user clicking a screen element by turning the background of that element pink. This is an action requiring a small piece of CSS that sets the 'background' style of the element to 'pink'. In ~ec~ it's just that:

/0//SHOWME/

In some cases this might be all you need; something simple that happens in response to a user action. But to do this in JavaScript means adding a separate script file, learning the syntax of all the commands needed and figuring how to 'wire it up' to your HTML. For programmers this is easy but for everyone else it's rocket science.

By contrast, the 'script' containing ~ec~ commands goes into a special element in your HTML and it's ready for use as soon as the page loads. No complicated compilers, linkers, loaders or other tools are needed; you just write what you want then refresh the page to see it in action.

If you'd like to know more we recommend you start with our /CODEX/, a combined tutorial, prorammer's playground and reference manual. Or you can browse the site links /SIDEBAR/.

## Features ##

The main features of ~ec~ are as follows:

~ec~ looks like English; not conversational English, admittedly, but the sort of English we use when giving directions or following a recipe. A formalized version of English, that doesn't use the symbols usually found in conventional programming languages, which cause ordinary people such grief when trying to match brackets or figure what a triple-equals is for.

~ec~ has a fully pluggable architecture, which means plugins can be written by any competent programmer and offered free or for a charge to provide any desired functionality to page builders.

~ec~ is for beginners. It's probably one of the simplest ways to start programming in general and website coding in particular.

~ec~ is also for experts. As a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool it makes for great productivity, enabling you to build web applications far more quickly. Use it in conjunction with other tools or by itself, avoid huge learning curves and build websites that are far easier to maintain.

~ec~ is easy to learn. Elsewhere in these pages you'll find sample code and complete websites with source code. You can also try writing your own scripts with the help of an online tutorial such as our coding playground, the /CODEX/.

~ec~ scripts are easy to read by most people who have an understanding of what is being done. They are experts in their domain and the script does its best to match that domain. Even so, there are some who don't want to do programming in any way yet would still like to enjoy the results of it. For you we offer a consultancy service. If you would like your pages enhanced in some specific way and are thinking maybe ~ec~ could do it, you can ask a question by joining our /SLACK/. We'll be pleased to discuss your needs in complete privacy and without obligation.

### The author ###

My name is Graham Trott. I've been writing easy-to-use high-level compilers for 30 years or so amd using them for a range of real-world projects. Since at the time of writing I'm now over 70 years old, ~ec~ will be the last in the line. This website, hosted by GitHub, is the public-facing side of the [EasyCoder repository](https://github.com/easycoder), where you will find all the source code, example programs and much more. The website will probably outlive me by some margin so I can't guarantee I'll be around to provide help, though you're welcome to try me at gtanyware@gmail.com.
