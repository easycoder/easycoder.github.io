# Website coding in English #

Most websites are quite easy to describe in English, yet programmers write their code in JavaScript, which looks nothing like English and which for anyone other than an expert is very hard to follow. So we created ~ec~, a language that looks a lot like English and lets you code much the same way you describe your site. It's a productivity tool you can use to build parts of websites or even entire websites.

For example, suppose you want to react to the user clicking a screen element by turning the background of that element pink. This is an action requiring a small piece of CSS that sets the 'background' style of the element to 'pink'. In ~ec~ it's just that:

/0//SHOWME/

In some cases this might be all you need; something simple that happens in response to a user action. But to do this in JavaScript means adding a separate script file, learning the syntax of all the commands needed and figuring how to 'wire it up' to your HTML. For programmers this is easy but for everyone else it's rocket science.

By contrast, the 'script' containing ~ec~ commands goes into a special element in your HTML and it's ready for use as soon as the page loads. No complicated compilers, linkers, loaders or other tools are needed; you just write what you want then refresh the page to see it in action.
