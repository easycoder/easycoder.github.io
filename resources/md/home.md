## The simple yet powerful alternative to JavaScript ##

~ec~ is a scripting language that looks a lot like English. It lets you build interactive websites or add interactivity to your existing website.

### What sort of things does it do? ###

- Many websites consist of a long single page that have to be scrolled to get to the details, but it can be hard to know where anything is and there's usually no effective organization. With a few lines of script such a page can be divided into sections that can be hidden and revealed one at a time like a slide deck.

- If you have a number of items on a page you could show which the user has already looked at by drawing an outline round each one, changing the background color or overlaying a tick in one corner.

- When the user leaves the page on their screen, after some period of time you can cause it to automatically cycle some part of its content, which might get their attention again.

- Any part of the screen can be replaced with new content taken from a remote server without the need to reload the page.

Although these features are the ones most likely to be used by the averge website owner, ~ec~ can do a lot more, to the point it can be used to build entire interactive websites without a single line of HTML or JavaScript ever being seen. A good example is our own site, that you're reading now.

### Do I need to learn programming? ###

No. It's not necessary for you to be an expert programmer. What matters is you know what you want to do and can express it logically. If you can describe clearly - in English - what your web page should do you're already half-way to an ~ec~ script. You can add one to any website in minutes and bring it to life, transforming it from static to lively and interactive.

### How do I find out more? ###

The best place to start is with our ~ec~ **Codex** - see the link /SIDEBAR/. The **Codex** is a page here on this website that teaches the basic features of ~ec~ and lets you try out example scripts in our coding playground. It includes a complete reference manual for the ~ec~ scripting language and it's intended to be used by people of all abilities.

Also look at  some of our examples (/SIDEBAR/). These are complete web pages you can copy to your own website and run.

After that it's time to add an ~ec~ script to your web page. The links /SIDEBAR/ include examples that should help you understand what you need to add to your website. If you need further help you can contact us in our [Slack](https://easycoder-software.slack.com/) channel. Don't be afraid to ask; everybody was a beginner once.
