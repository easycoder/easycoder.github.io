## Capture user input /SHOW-USERCAPTURE/

This is a rewrite of a script published in [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/introduction-alpinejs-javascript-framework/) as an example of how to use the Alpine.js micro-framework. It represents a block added to a web page, that displays an announcement and handles feedback from users.
~<div id="ex-usercapture"></div>~
The User Capture can be run as an independent web page; see [User Capture](https://easycoder.github.io/examples/usercapture). If you view the page source you will see the entire script inside its special preformatted element.

## Storyteller

Storyteller is a tool for building static websites using Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is much easier to learn and is very suited to pages that comprise a single column of text, with headings, images and links to other pages. The structure of the site is one of subjects that contain topics; each subject is a folder and each topic is a single text file written in Markdown. All the images used by the subject and its topics are placed in a folder inside that subject folder.

To use Storyteller all you need is to copy a short `index.html` file to your server and provide the topics as described. This is all covered by the documentation on the [Storyteller website](https://easycoder.github.io/examples/storyteller).

Storyteller is written in ~ec~; its source code is in the [Storyteller repository](https://github.com/easycoder/storyteller).

## The Game of Life /SHOW-LIFE/

This is a "cellular automaton" - a no-player game devised in 1970 by John Conway. The "player" sets up an initial configuration and observes the game running according to a simple set of rules.

Click /LIFEDOC/ for a description of the program.
