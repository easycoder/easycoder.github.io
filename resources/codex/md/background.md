# Background information #
This is the ~ec~ **Codex**, a comprehensive free resource aimed at two groups of people:

**Beginners** can learn to code using English-like scripts, with no prior experience needed, no need to set up hosting or to download any software. **Codex** includes a comprehensive tutorial with many working examples.

**Experts** can leverage the ~ec~ technology to achieve better productivity. When the **Codex** is installed on a server it allows direct access by the owner of the site to all the site code, which can be developed and maintained on any PC or even a smartphone.

~ec~ was originally developed as a WordPress plugin, to offer non-programmers a relatively painless way to customize aspects of their pages and add simple interactivity based on DOM manipulation. As it developed it became clear that it was capable of far more than mere tweaks and was soon employed as the engine behind several complete websites. Further development resulted in the **Codex**, a complete IDE for website coding and a tutorial for programmers, both novice and expert.

~ec~ is written in vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies except those called for by optional plugins. The total package size - with all features used - is about 250kB so it forms a fairly minor addition to a web page. However, it implements a complete scripting language able to perform all the major functions required by any website, and its plugin architecture allows extra functionality to be added by anyone in a seamless manner.

Sites built with ~ec~ need no JavaScript in their site logic, and because scripts are easy to understand it takes only a short time for a new programmer to become familiar with the language. This is great for productivity. For the same reason, maintenance of the site is made far easier than is otherwise commonly the case. Both these factors result in a drastic lowering of the overall TCO of the site.

This is in sharp contrast to how most websites are built. There, the emphasis is on highly professional frameworks requiring massive learning investment. There's a strong probability that smaller sites will become unmaintainable long before their scheduled end of life because it costs too much to retain these skills.

There will be some websites for which a high level of investment in advanced software tools can be justified, but in too many cases the results are over-engineered and do not provide a clear maintenance path. ~ec~ does not aim to take over the world, merely to offer an alternative when the current 'best practice' does not work to the clear benefit of the customer.
