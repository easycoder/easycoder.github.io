# C++ runtime engine for scripts compiled with Easycoder (Python version)

Under development

The Python version of EasyCoder has a compile option that generates a compressed file instead of running the code.

Work is currently under way to build a runtime in C++, that takes the compiler output and runs it on a device such as an ESP8266. This should make programming such devices far simpler. The runtime will be able to download and execute compiled scripts on demand.
