Vehicle Checks is a Web App<sup>1</sup> designed for smartphones, that allows you to easily keep records of fleet vehicle checks.

Most companies that run a vehicle fleet have a standard procedure for conducting periodic checks on their vehicles. These checks are performed to a regular schedule, often weekly, and ensure that important maintenance is not overlooked. This web app avoids the need for paperwork by doing everything on a smartphone.

The home screen of the web app looks like this:

There are only 3 actions you can take. Tap the gear icon to go to the Setup page; tap the 'i' button to read this documentation, or tap anywhere else on the screen to show a list of your vehicles. Initially there are none, so tap the gear icon to add your vehicle(s).

<sup>1</sup> A Web App is like a smartphone app but it runs directly from a web page without having to be installed on your device. The VehicleChecks web app is designed to run on any smartphone. All the vehicle data is held on the phone itself, and records are exported by email. Each phone that is used to run the web app must be individually configured with the appropriate vehicle data.

This WebApp is under development, so new features will be added from time to time. Anyone wishing to comment, make suggestions or even join the development effort can reach us at [vehiclecheck@easycoder.software](mailto:vehiclecheck@easycoder.software).
