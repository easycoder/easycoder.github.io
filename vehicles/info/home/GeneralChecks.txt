## General checks

This section is where you deal with all the yes/no checks. The screen looks like this:

Each item has one of three states:

**Untested or Not Applicable** No check has been done.

**Pass** The test passed.

**Warning** There is an issue of some kind.

Tap the icon to move from one of these states to the next then back to the first. If the oil check passed the screen would then look like this:

In the event of a problem, tap the button to reach the the **Warning** icon. A text box then opens:

In the box, type the nature of the problem and the remedy chosen, if any. For example, you might type

`Low oil level - topped up`

When you have dealt with all the items in the list, tap the **Tyres** button to move on to that section.
