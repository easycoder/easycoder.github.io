## Tyres

In this section you deal with tyres. The screen looks like this:

The first part of the screen deals with tyre tread depths. The labels are:

**NSF** Nearside Front

**OSF** Offside Front

**NSR** Nearside Rear

**OSR** Offside Rear

For each of these, measure the depth and tap the + and - buttons to increase the displayed setting by one tenth of a millimetre each time. (The app remembers the value so you won't have to do so much tapping next time.)

The second part of the sreen deals with tyre pressures. The values in brackets are the ones you set in the **Settings** screen for this vehicle. As with tread depth, tap the + and - buttons to get to the measured value.

The final part of the testing deals with damage to the bodywork of the vehicle.
