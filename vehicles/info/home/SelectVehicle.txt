## Selecting a vehicle on the Home screen

When you tap the Home screen you will see a list of all the vehicles in your fleet. In this example there's only one:

Choose a vehicle from the list and you will go to the main data entry screen:

At the top and bottom are buttons labeled Save, Send and Close:

**Save** saves all of your editing. The next time you visit the page for this vehicle, all the data values you changed will be presented the same as they are now.

**Send** sends the result of your vehicle check by email. When you tap it, your default email client is called to present a new message preloaded with the results of your checks.

**Close** returns you to the Home screen.

In between the 2 rows of buttons there are 3 sections:

**General Checks** deals with most of the standard vehicle checks, such as oil level, lighting and the condition of mirrors.

**Tyres** deals with tyre tread depths and pressures.

**Bodywork** is where you record any damage to the vehicle.

Tap each of these section headers to open it up or to close it again.
