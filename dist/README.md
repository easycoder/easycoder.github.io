# EasyCoder server files
 
Here are 2 small REST servers written in Python and PHP, which both perform the same functions. The former is for setting up a `localhost` server and the latter is for use on LAMP servers.

These REST servers give your browser scripts read and write access to files on your own website and to remote servers if CORS has been set up.

The files `easycoder.php`, `ec-rest.txt` and `readme.txt` are for WordPress installations.

The `plugins` folder holds a variety of plugins, some documented better than others.
