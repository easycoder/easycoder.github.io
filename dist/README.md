 # EasyCoder distribution file set

 Here are the distribution files. Load `easycoder.js` or `easycoder-min.js` into your document, either in HEAD or at the end of BODY; from there on your scripts can request everything else they need.
 
 The rest are server-side files. The most significant are 2 small REST servers written in PHP and Python, which perform the same functions. The former is for setting up a `localhost` server and the latter is for use on LAMP servers.

 The files `easycoder.php`, `ec-rest.txt` and `readme.txt` are for WordPress installations.
